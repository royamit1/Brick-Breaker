# Arkanoid Game
This project introduces a rendition of the classic Arkanoid game, developed as part of an Object Oriented Programming course.
Arkanoid is a classic brick-breaking game where the player controls a paddle to deflect a ball against a wall of bricks. The goal of the game is to clear all of the bricks by breaking them. The player can lose the game by letting the ball fall below the bottom of the screen.

I implemented the game with Java language using Intellij IDEA Ultimate IDE, using the following OOP principals:
* Polymorphism and inheritance.
* Usage of basic design patterns in OOP, such as Observer, Builder, etc.
* Usage of several generic collections and data structures such as linked lists and arraylists.
* Working with GUI.

## Usage

1. Download the project from Github :
```
git clone https://github.com/royamit1/Brick-Breaker.git
```
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory.
3. Launch the game with specific levels via the command : 

```
ant run -Dargs="{levels}"
``` 
Replace {levels} with the desired levels, e.g., 1 3 4 for levels 1, 3, and 4.  

## Controls

* Use the arrow keys to move the paddle.
* Press 'P' to pause the game and spacebar to resume it.
